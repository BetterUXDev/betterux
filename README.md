## STRICT NONOS
1. Never Merge anything yourself, i'll check your work before merging it
2. In Wordpress, never update the wordpress version regardless of how temping it is.

## Cloning Repo to XAMPP
1. Create a FORK of the MASTER RESPOSITORY
2. Clone FORK into htdocs*
3. Create branch in Git Bash (terminal)
4. goto "localhost/betterux" (hope everything loads right, you should see the dashboard)


*htdocs folder is inside xampp folder (in OS X htdocs has a shortcut to htdocs, but the actual folder is burried inside of the other folder)*
